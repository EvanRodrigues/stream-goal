# stream-tools

Originally an OBS fundraising bar for twitch.tv, this project is now a platform that I use to distribute my twitch widgets to streamers. The project is currently hosted [here](https://stream-goal.herokuapp.com).

## Widgets

Currently the only widget available is a [fundraising goal bar](docs/goal_bar.md).

## User Registration (In Development)

New users will be registered when they login with their Twitch account for the first time.

## What I Learned

-   Developing an API using Node.js
-   React/Redux
-   Managing cookies
